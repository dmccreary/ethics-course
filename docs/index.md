# Welcome

Ethics is not just about right and wrong — it's about understanding the invisible systems that shape our choices. By combining critical thinking, systems thinking, and data science, we can make sense of complex global challenges and discover where small changes can make the biggest difference.

This book is designed to help you think critically about ethical challenges in our world, their overall impact to our planet and the people that live here. We apply both data science and critical thinking skills to find the root causes of these challenges and look for cost-effective solutions. We use the lens of systems thinking to look for leverage points to promote positive change.

In this course, you will progress through three stages:

1. **Understanding** — learn how to recognize unethical systems and measure their impacts.
2. **Analyzing** — apply data science and systems thinking to trace causes and interconnections.
3. **Acting** — identify leverage points and advocate for sustainable, ethical change.

This book places a strong focus on the use of graphs and charts to understand ethical behavior in our world as well as the use of graphical storytelling to explain the complexities of the systems that cause harm.

### Chapter 3: Gathering and Validating Data
How do we get unbiased data and make it objective?
Methods for detecting bias, ethical data collection principles, and source credibility assessment.

**Part II: Seeing the Bigger Picture**

### Chapter 4: Mapping Impact Networks
After we collect data, how do we understand the total impact of specific behaviors and industries?
Visual analysis methods including causal loop diagrams, network analysis, and multivariate harm models.

### Chapter 5: Systems Thinking and Root Cause Analysis
What is systems thinking and how do we apply it to ethical analysis?
Systems archetypes, stock-and-flow models, and methods for finding root causes.

**Part III: Acting for Change**

### Chapter 6: Finding Leverage Points
Apply Donella Meadows' 12 leverage points framework to identify high-impact intervention opportunities.
Industry-by-industry analysis of transformation strategies.

### Chapter 7: Advocating and Designing Ethical Interventions
Practical approaches to implementing change through behavioral economics, policy design, corporate responsibility, and citizen engagement.

### Chapter 8: Capstone - Data-Driven Ethical Reform Project
Synthesize your learning by selecting an industry, gathering data, building systems models, identifying leverage points, and presenting an evidence-based proposal for systemic reform.
