## About This Visualization

This interactive bubble chart visualizes the comparative harm of 16 major industries across two critical dimensions:

- **Y-Axis (Vertical)**: Harm to People - measured through deaths, DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years), and direct human suffering
- **X-Axis (Horizontal)**: Harm to Planet - measured through environmental externalities, carbon emissions, and ecosystem damage
- **Bubble Size**: Economic Impact - relative economic footprint of the industry

### How to Use

- **Hover** over any bubble to see detailed information about that industry
- Each industry is represented by a different colored circle
- Industries in the upper-right quadrant cause high harm to both people and planet
- Larger bubbles represent industries with greater economic impact

### Key Insights

The visualization helps identify:
- Industries with disproportionate harm relative to their economic contribution
- Trade-offs between human health impacts and environmental damage
- High-impact targets for ethical reform and intervention
- Patterns in how different sectors concentrate harm

### Data Source

Industry rankings and harm metrics are based on the research compiled in [Chapter 2: Measuring Harm](../../chapters/02-measuring-harm/ranking.md), drawing from authoritative sources including WHO, FAO, ILO, and peer-reviewed epidemiological studies.

### Learning Applications

This visualization supports:
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding interconnected harm across multiple dimensions
- **Leverage Point Analysis**: Identifying high-impact intervention opportunities
- **Ethical Decision Making**: Comparing industries using data-driven frameworks
- **Advocacy Planning**: Prioritizing reform efforts based on quantified harm
