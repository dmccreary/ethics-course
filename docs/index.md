# Welcome

Welcome to our book on ethics.  In this book we use critical thinking and data science to understand some
of the ethical challenges we have in our world, their overall impact to our planet and the people that live here.  We then apply both data science and critical thinking skills to find the root causes of these challenges and look
for cost-effective solutions.  We use the lens of systems thinking to look for leverage points to promote positive change.

This book is not a book on the moral philosophy of ethics.  It is a practical guide to understanding how unethical behavior arises in our world and how unethical industries have a negative impact on our planet and the people that live there.

This book places a strong focus on the use of graphs and charts to understand ethical behavior in our world as well as the use of graphical storytelling to explain the complexities of the systems that cause harm.
