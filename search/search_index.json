Strengthen Chapter Flow and Transitions","text":"Chapter Suggested Enhancement Rationale 1. Introduction Add a short history of ethics (from moral philosophy to applied ethics and data ethics). Clarify why data-driven ethics is a new frontier. Creates context and credibility. 2. Measuring Harm Include frameworks such as social cost accounting, life-cycle analysis (LCA), externalities, human suffering indices, or DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). Provides concrete metrics and analytical depth. 3. Gathering Data Add methods for detecting bias (sampling bias, confirmation bias, survivorship bias). Introduce ethical data collection principles (e.g., informed consent, privacy). Strengthens credibility and ties to data ethics. 4. Impact Analysis Introduce causal loop diagrams, graph-based correlation networks, or multivariate harm models. Include a short case study (e.g., tobacco, fast fashion, or cryptocurrency). Makes the analysis practical and visual. 5. Systems Thinking Expand with standard systems archetypes (e.g., \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d, \u201cShifting the Burden\u201d). Show causal loop diagrams and stock\u2013flow models. Deepens conceptual understanding. 6. Looking for Leverage Include Donella Meadows\u2019 \u201c12 Leverage Points\u201d framework with examples of effective interventions. Connects theory to action. 7. Advocating for Change Add content on behavioral economics, policy design, corporate social responsibility, and citizen engagement strategies.
