# Scorecard

Here's a **comparative scorecard** of the **Top 16 Most Harmful Industries** in the world today.
Each industry is scored qualitatively across key harm dimensions: **Health (mortality/DALYs)**, 
**Economic cost**, **Human rights / social harm**, **Environmental harm**, 
and **Overall harm index** (1 = worst).
All figures are approximate or normalized from global literature.

### Key takeaways

* **Public-health giants (tobacco, alcohol, diet, fossil fuels)** dominate global mortality and economic cost.
* **Rights-based harms (slavery, trafficking, arms trade)** cause fewer direct deaths but extreme suffering per victim.
* **Digital harms (cybercrime, crypto, gambling, pornography)** show massive economic and psychological impact but relatively low direct mortality—though they can undermine societal trust at scale.
* **Environmental harms (fossil fuels, livestock, deforestation, fast fashion)** are the most long-lived and intergenerational.
