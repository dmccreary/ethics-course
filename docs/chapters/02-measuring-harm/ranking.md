# Ranking of Harmful Industries

Below is a single, cross-sector ranking of the 16 most harmful (i.e., **net-negative**) industries/sectors today, blending the strongest like-for-like metrics we can get across domains: **deaths/DALYs**, **economic costs**, **scale of exploitation/rights abuse**, and **environmental externalities**. Where figures are uncertain (e.g., criminal markets), I cite the most authoritative ranges and call out caveats.

> Quick note on scope: "Industries" below also includes large, persistent **criminal economies** (e.g., trafficking, cybercrime) when they function like industries.


## Top 16 most harmful industries
1 = most harmful

### 1. Tobacco

-   **Primary harm:** massive premature mortality & morbidity from NCDs; second-hand smoke.

-   **Magnitude:** **\>7--8+ million deaths/year** globally. [World Health Organization+1](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

-   **Why #1:** the most consistently measured behavior-linked killer with large DALYs across all regions.

### 2. Alcohol

-   **Primary harm:** injuries (crashes, violence), cancers, liver disease; social costs.

-   **Magnitude:** **~2.6 million deaths/year** (2019 baseline), ~**4.7% of all deaths**; country studies put **social/economic costs ~2--3% GDP**. [World Health Organization+1](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/alcohol?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3.Fossil Fuels

Energy / air-pollution--intensive production

-   **Primary harm:** ambient + household air pollution (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancers); climate.

-   **Magnitude:** **~8.1 million deaths in 2021** attributable to air pollution (not all fossil---but heavily driven by it). [State of Global Air](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/resources/report/state-global-air-report-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

-   **Why not #1:** avoids double-counting household biomass; still, the public-health burden is extraordinary.

### 4. Ultra-processed Foods

 unhealthy diet industry (incl. sugary beverages)**

-   **Primary harm:** diet-related NCDs (CVD, diabetes, some cancers).

-   **Magnitude:** **~11 million deaths (2017)** attributable to **dietary risks** (UPFs are a major driver within this risk family). [PubMed+1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954305/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 5. Illicit drugs
non-medical drug trade

-   **Primary harm:** overdoses, blood-borne infections, violence, crime; very high DALYs.

[World Health Organization+1](https://www.who.int/news/item/25-06-2024-over-3-million-annual-deaths-due-to-alcohol-and-drug-use-majority-among-men?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 6. Sex trafficking

Forced commercial sexual exploitation (part of modern slavery)**

-   **Primary harm:** extreme, chronic rights abuse and trauma.

-   **Magnitude:** **50 million** in modern slavery (any given day, 2021), **6.3 million** in forced commercial sexual exploitation; **~US$236 billion/yr** in illegal profits. [International Labour Organization+1](https://www.ilo.org/publications/major-publications/global-estimates-modern-slavery-forced-labour-and-forced-marriage?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 7. Arms Trade 
organized violent conflict ecosystem

-   **Primary harm:** battle and civilian deaths, displacement, destroyed health systems.

-   **Magnitude:** **~122,500 battle-related deaths in 2023** (UCDP); **world military spend = US$2.44T (2023) → US$2.72T (2024)** shows scale of the sector. [SAGE Journals+2SIPRI+2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00223433241262912?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 8. Cybercrime 
Hackers & ransomware

-   **Primary harm:** large financial losses, critical-infrastructure disruption, spillover safety risks (e.g., hospital outages).

-   **Magnitude:** **US$16.6 billion reported losses (U.S., 2024)**; global estimates put **total cybercrime at ~US$10.5T/yr by 2025** (methodologically broad but widely cited). [Internet Crime Complaint Center+2Federal Bureau of Investigation+2](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 9. Healthcare Fraud

-   **Primary harm:** diverted medical resources, delayed/denied care, patient safety risks, financial burden on healthcare systems.

-   **Magnitude:** **US$68--230 billion/yr** in the U.S. alone (National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates); **3--10% of total healthcare spending** globally; patient harm through unnecessary procedures and delayed legitimate care.

### 10. Human smuggling
Distinct from trafficking

-   **Primary harm:** deaths during irregular journeys; exploitation and extortion.

-   **Magnitude:** **~8,938 migrant deaths in 2024 (record)**; smuggling market **~US$5.5--7B/yr** on key routes (2016 est.). [International Organization for Migration+1](https://www.iom.int/news/2024-deadliest-year-record-migrants-new-iom-data-reveals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 11. Gambling Industry

### 16. Pornography
 (legal/adult)

-   **Primary harm (to a subset):** problematic use linked to mental-health/relationship issues; broader population-level harm metrics are limited/contested.

-   **Magnitude:** research finds **PPU** (problematic pornography use) in **single-digit to low-double-digit %** of users in some samples; no robust global mortality/economic-cost totals. [PMC+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9755930/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## A few framing notes


-   **Apples vs. oranges:** A perfect cross-domain ruler doesn't exist. I prioritized **mortality/DALYs** (where available), then **economic costs** and **documented rights abuses**; environmental externalities were weighted by scale and persistence.

-   **Regional variation:** Some harms (e.g., gambling, cybercrime) have rich national cost studies but thin global syntheses; rankings could shift under different weights (e.g., climate-only, U.S.-only).

-   **Intersections:** Several sectors amplify others (e.g., cybercrime ↔ crypto, deforestation ↔ livestock/feed, fossil fuels ↔ air pollution). I kept them distinct to show relative scale.
