Textbooks began including case studies\u2014should this patient receive the transplant? Is this marketing campaign deceptive? This era democratized ethics, making it relevant to professional practice rather than just philosophical contemplation.</p> <p>Data Ethics (2000s-present) The digital revolution introduced new challenges around privacy, algorithmic bias, and surveillance. Ethics textbooks began incorporating discussions of big data, machine learning fairness, and digital rights.
