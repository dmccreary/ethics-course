Use the MicroSim-p5 skill to create a new MicroSim for this course.  You

 microsim is a 2-D bubble chart.  On the vertical Y-axis is harm to people. 
 On the horizontal X-Axis is harm to our planet.  Use the data in the 
/docs/rankings.md file as your starting point.  For each unethical industry,
 place a circle of a different color on the chart.  The size of the circle 
should indicate the relative size of the overall industry as far a economic 
impact.  When the user hovers over the circle, a tooltip will show a summary
 of the industry.
