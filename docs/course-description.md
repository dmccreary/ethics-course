## ETHICS: Data-Driven Ethics and Systems Change

**3 Credit Hours | Prerequisites: STATS 201 or DATA 101 or instructor permission**

### Course Description

This innovative course transforms traditional ethics education by integrating data science, systems thinking, and advocacy strategies to address the most harmful industries and behaviors in modern society. Students will move beyond philosophical debates to measure, analyze, and design interventions for real-world ethical challenges affecting millions globally.

### Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy)

#### Remember & Understand
- **Identify** and **describe** the 16 most harmful industries globally, including their mortality rates, economic costs, and social impacts
- **Recognize** common systems archetypes (Tragedy of the Commons, Shifting the Burden, Success to the Successful) in unethical industry behaviors
- **Define** key measurement frameworks including DALYs, social cost accounting, and life-cycle analysis

#### Apply
- **Apply** harm measurement frameworks to quantify industry impacts across health, environmental, economic, and social dimensions
- **Use** ethical data collection methods to gather unbiased information from government, academic, and NGO sources
- **Implement** causal loop diagrams and network visualizations to map industry impact relationships

#### Analyze
- **Analyze** root causes of systemic harm using the 5 Whys technique and iceberg model
- **Compare** industries using normalized metrics (harm per $1B revenue, per capita impact)
- **Examine** feedback loops and unintended consequences in complex ethical systems
- **Investigate** power dynamics and stakeholder relationships affecting industry behavior

#### Evaluate
- **Evaluate** the relative effectiveness of Donella Meadows' 12 leverage points for system intervention
- **Assess** data quality, source credibility, and potential biases in industry reporting
- **Critique** existing policy interventions and corporate social responsibility initiatives
- **Judge** the feasibility and impact potential of proposed reform strategies

#### Create
- **Design** comprehensive reform proposals using multi-level intervention strategies
- **Develop** advocacy campaigns incorporating behavioral economics and policy design principles
- **Construct** visual data stories that communicate complex ethical issues to diverse audiences
- **Produce** an evidence-based capstone project proposing systemic reform for a chosen industry

### Course Topics

**Part I: Understanding Ethics Through Systems**
- Data-driven ethics methodology vs. traditional moral philosophy
- Measuring harm: Environmental degradation, human suffering indices, externalities
- Ethical data gathering and bias detection

**Part II: Seeing the Bigger Picture**
- Impact network mapping and multivariate harm models
- Systems thinking and root cause analysis
- Stock-and-flow dynamics in harmful industries

**Part III: Acting for Change**
- Leverage point identification and intervention design
- Behavioral economics applications for ethical change
- Movement building and stakeholder advocacy strategies

### Featured Industry Case Studies
- Tobacco (7-8 million deaths annually)
- Fossil fuels and air pollution (8 million deaths annually)
- Ultra-processed foods (11 million diet-related deaths)
- Fast fashion, cybercrime, industrial agriculture, and more

### Capstone Project
Students synthesize learning by selecting an industry, gathering data, building systems models, identifying leverage points, and presenting a comprehensive reform proposal with implementation strategy and success metrics.

### Assessment Methods
- Industry harm scorecards (20%)
- Systems mapping assignments (20%)
